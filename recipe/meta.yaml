    # NOTE: on most platforms, except
    # PPC64, we are forcing static linking
    # to LLVM in a desperate attempt to hide
    # LLVM symbols so that heyoka can coexist
    # (maybe) with other libraries linking to
    # different LLVM versions. On the other hand,
    # the conda packages for llvm/llvmdev inject
    # (on some platforms at least) a run_export()
    # dependency under the assumption
    # that dynamic linking is being used. We want to
    # avoid that, as the whole point is to hide
    # the presence of LLVM as much as possible.
